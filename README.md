Mixer is a tool for generating permutations of glyphs from lists. I use it for building font proofs.

Mixer is intended to be edited on-the-fly, adding and removing function calls as needed. This is easier than making all this stuff work with command-line switches that you won’t remember anyway.

Mixer contains lots of encoding and codecs functions to get the non-ASCII stuff working. Some of them were added years ago and aren’t necessary anymore. But it’s easier to just leave them in than it is to figure out which ones can be deleted.
